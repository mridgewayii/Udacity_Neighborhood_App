# Udacity_Neighborhood_App
Udacity Javascript, Bootstrap, Knockout.js, Jquery.js, Foursquare API and Google Maps API project
## Program Description
This program is completely fed by data from APIs or variables set in an initial array.  Google Maps API provides the GIS services and Foursquare API provides much of the location information details.  Knockout properly displays the information and allows it to be filtered based on a search.  Bootstrap framework (3.7) provides cross-platform operation and styling.
## Requirements
You must extract the compressed file and open the index.html file in your browser of choice.  This application has been tested in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge for proper operation.  Other browsers are not assured proper operation.

 ## Acknowledgements
 A significant portion of this program is either a direct representation or a modification of the lectures in the Udacity FSND program.  This includes but is not limited to the Google Map API instructions and the overall formatting of the javascript code.  While all of the data has been taylored to meet the current design, there will still be many similarities to the Udacity lectures.
 
 Additionally, Google Developer supplied code was used extensively throughout the project.  Locations where this was taken directly from Google's Developer Site was notated where possible in the code by way of comments.
